# Piazza Revert

This userscript is intended for use with [Piazza](https://piazza.com)'s new UI. This UI suffers from severe design flaws such as excessive padding on desktops, missing contrast between question/answer elements, etc.
The userscript aims to address these pitfalls. Overall, it attempts to follow a design inspired by Piazza's legacy UI.

In the future it may also add some small quality-of-life features. Currently one is implemented: support for displaying multiple instructor endorsements.
