# Piazza Revert

This userscript is intended for use with [Piazza](https://piazza.com)'s new UI. This UI suffers from severe design flaws such as excessive padding on desktops, missing contrast between question/answer elements, etc.
The userscript aims to address these pitfalls. Overall, it attempts to follow a design inspired by Piazza's legacy UI.

In the future it may also add some small quality-of-life features. Currently one is implemented: support for displaying multiple instructor endorsements.

## How to use

1. Ensure you have a userscript extension (I use [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), but any Greasemonkey derivative will likely work) installed in your browser.
2. Open the raw userscript in your browser after the extension is installed: https://github.com/embeddedt/piazza-revert/raw/refs/heads/main/revert.user.js

   This should bring up a window asking you to confirm installation of the script. Once it is installed, refresh Piazza.
